/ Was able to lose focus permanently somehow, despite menu still flashing
/   Long-term focus solutions?
/ Internet Explorer issues
/	AJAX HS "Loading..." does not seem to send cookies??
/	Rendering seems 1px smaller in height -- bar along bottom
/ "Less than a minute ago" in alltime & friends hs's is wrong
/ Resume on sleep => superfast play
/ Instructions about destroyer block
/ Track play time
/ Integrate contiguous-destroyer, scoring
/ Report level that you're on
/ Something's still not right with the scaled cache. sometimes an invisible picture can get stuck in there, wont go away til resize.
/ After auth through scrshot link:  NameError (uninitialized constant Facebook::CANVAS_LOCATION):  app/controllers/sessions_controller.rb:21:in `create'
