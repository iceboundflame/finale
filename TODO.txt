BUGS
  Resume on sleep => superfast play

  Internet Explorer issues
	Was able to lose focus permanently somehow, despite menu still flashing
		Long-term focus solutions?
/	AJAX HS "Loading..." does not seem to send cookies??
/	Rendering seems 1px smaller in height -- bar along bottom
/ "Less than a minute ago" in alltime & friends hs's is wrong

/ Integrate contiguous-destroyer, scoring

/ Report level that you're on
/ Something's still not right with the scaled cache. sometimes an invisible picture can get stuck in there, wont go away til resize.
